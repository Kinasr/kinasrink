Hello! I'm Khaled Nasr, a Software Engineer in Test based in Egypt. I've dedicated my career to ensuring that software products are not just functional but also deliver a seamless and exceptional user experience.

## My Journey in Software Testing

My journey started with freelance testing roles on platforms like Test IO, Tester Work, and uTest, where I honed my skills by identifying critical issues in well-known products like Facebook and Instagram. This experience provided a strong foundation in various manual testing techniques.

Transitioning into full-time roles, I joined **Tribal** as a Software Engineer in Test, diving into the fintech world. There, I played a key role in initiating the team's automation efforts, designing a comprehensive framework to test both API and UI levels using tools like REST Assured, Selenium, and JMeter.

Currently, at **C3S**, I continue to build and refine test automation frameworks. My responsibilities include automating end-to-end test cases, creating integrated REST Assured tests, enhancing CI/CD pipelines for integration testing, collaborating with developers on unit tests, and designing scripts for performance and load testing.

## Technical Skills & Expertise

I have hands-on experience across the testing spectrum:

* Test Automation: Proficient in GUI automation with Selenium and Cypress, mobile automation with Appium, and API automation with REST Assured.
* Testing Types: Experienced in functional, UI/UX, localization, web, API, mobile, and desktop testing.
* Performance Testing: Skilled in using JMeter to design and execute performance tests.
* Methodologies & Tools: Familiar with BDD using Cucumber, writing SQL queries, and utilizing tools like JIRA and TestLink.
* Programming: Comfortable working with Java, Kotlin, GO and JavaScript.

## Open Source & Projects

I'm a believer in the power of open source and enjoy contributing to the community. I'm the creator of **NSR-YAML** and **NSR-JSON**, lightweight Java libraries for parsing YAML and JSON files respectively. I've also had the rewarding experience of contributing to the **SHAFT-ENGINE**, an open-source unified test automation engine.

## Education & Continuous Learning

I hold a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering (Electronics and Electrical Communication) from Al-Azhar University. My passion for learning didn't stop there. I'm constantly seeking to expand my skillset and am currently diving into the world of **penetration testing** to deepen my understanding of software security.

## Beyond the Code

I thrive on challenges and enjoy collaborative environments where I can work with cross-functional teams. My goal is always to contribute to customer satisfaction and drive business success through high-quality software. I approach problems with critical thinking, curiosity, and adaptability.

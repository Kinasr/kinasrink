<p>My journey started with freelance testing roles on platforms like Test IO, Tester Work, and uTest, where I honed my skills by identifying critical issues in well-known products like Facebook and Instagram. This experience provided a strong foundation in various manual testing techniques.</p>
<p>Transitioning into full-time roles, I joined <strong>Tribal</strong> as a Software Engineer in Test, diving into the fintech world. There, I played a key role in initiating the team&rsquo;s automation efforts, designing a comprehensive framework to test both API and UI levels using tools like REST Assured, Selenium, and JMeter.</p>
<p>Currently, at <strong>C3S</strong>, I continue to build and refine test automation frameworks. My responsibilities include automating end-to-end test cases, creating integrated REST Assured tests, enhancing CI/CD pipelines for integration testing, collaborating with developers on unit tests, and designing scripts for performance and load testing.</p>

<p>I have hands-on experience across the testing spectrum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test Automation: Proficient in GUI automation with Selenium and Cypress, mobile automation with Appium, and API automation with REST Assured.</li>
<li>Testing Types: Experienced in functional, UI/UX, localization, web, API, mobile, and desktop testing.</li>
<li>Performance Testing: Skilled in using JMeter to design and execute performance tests.</li>
<li>Methodologies &amp; Tools: Familiar with BDD using Cucumber, writing SQL queries, and utilizing tools like JIRA and TestLink.</li>
<li>Programming: Comfortable working with Java, Kotlin, GO and JavaScript.</li>
